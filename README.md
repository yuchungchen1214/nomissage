# NoMissage

A small native macOS menu bar app for recording Messenger conversations to a local JSON file.

NoMissage was made because Meta's official data export can be incomplete, difficult to use, and not suitable for continuously collecting recent conversations. This app provides a simple local record for AI-assisted summaries, review, and work support.

## Main functionality

- Reads the active Messenger conversation in Google Chrome
- Reads only when Chrome is in the foreground and the active tab is on `messenger.com`
- Supports personal and group conversations
- Records `sent_at`, `sender`, `type`, and `text`
- Removes duplicate messages
- Keeps a configurable record window from 1 to 999 days
- Lets users choose the JSON folder and filename
- Starts and stops from the app or menu bar
- Optional launch and recording at login
- No hidden LaunchAgent; quitting the app stops recording

## Supported Messenger languages

The parser currently supports:

- English
- Español
- 繁體中文 (Traditional Chinese)

The app interface is English. Conversation names and message content remain in their original language.

## Permissions

macOS may ask NoMissage for permission to control Google Chrome. Allow it in:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation**

Chrome may also ask to allow JavaScript from Apple Events. This is required to read the visible Messenger page.

---

## Data and privacy

Records stay on your Mac as unencrypted JSON. NoMissage does not upload messages or send them to a server.

Please protect the record file and consider the privacy of everyone included in the conversations. NoMissage only reads content available in the active Messenger page; it does not retrieve every historical conversation automatically.
